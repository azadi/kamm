ਕੰਮ (Kamm)
========

The easiest to-do list manager ever!

Introduction
------------

`Kamm` (*Punjabi* for *work*) is a to-do list manager written in Python with simplicity as the primary motivation. Adding, changing or deleting tasks in `Kamm` is amazingly simple and fast!

As `Kamm` is a no-frills to-do manager, note that there are no advance features; you can only add, change or delete tasks. Think of it as the offline version of *Google Tasks* (with respect to ease of use).

Usage
-----
    kmm.py [options]
    Options:
        -a      Add tasks
        -s      Show all tasks
        -c      Change tasks
        -d      Delete all tasks
